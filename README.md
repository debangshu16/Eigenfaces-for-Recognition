# Eigenfaces-for-Recognition
This project aims at emulating the works of M.Turk et. al. in ”Eigenfaces for Recognition” [1]. The authors had treated the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional recognition problem rather than requiring the recovery of three dimensional geometry, (taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright) . So a face may be described by a small set of 2D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the variations among known face images. The significant features are termed as “eigenfaces” as they are the eigenvectors of the training set of faces. These features do not necessarily correspond to features like nose, eyes, mouth, etc. However, the projection operation characterizes any face image as a weighted sum of the eigenface features and hence for recognition purposes we only need to compare these weights with the weights of known people.
